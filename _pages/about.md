<h2>About</h2>

</center>

I am a Professor of Economics at the University of Oregon. Prior to joining the faculty at Oregon, I spent five years as an Economist and Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and one year as an Economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

My research is focused on forecasting and macroeconomics, with much of my work studying business cycles and inflation. I use time-series econometrics, Bayesian econometrics, and machine learning methods in my research, and frequently find myself writing papers on econometric methodology. I am currently an Associate Editor of the *Journal of Money, Credit and Banking* and *Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics*.

I was born in Edmonds, Washington and grew up in the shadow of Mt. Rainier in Auburn, Washington. I received my bachelor’s degree in economics from Seattle Pacific University, and my master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from the University of Washington.
